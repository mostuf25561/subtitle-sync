# Tasks

## Task 53: Android E2E YouTube Share Intent Verification, Screencast Video Recording & GitHub Pages Presentation

- [x] **Subtask 53.1: Android E2E YouTube Link Share Testing (Browser & Official YouTube App)**:
  - Implement E2E tests validating that YouTube links shared from either:
    1. A web browser (via `ACTION_VIEW` with `youtube.com/watch?v=...`, `youtu.be/...`, or shorts).
    2. The official YouTube app (via `ACTION_SEND` with plain text or prefixed text like `"Check out this video on YouTube: ..."`).
  - Assert that `MainActivity.kt` and WebView bridge (`window.onNativeSharedLinkReceived`) cleanly switch to the shared video, reset state, and initiate caption discovery without crashing or reloading the entire webview session.
  - Add test coverage in `e2e/emulation.spec.ts` and `cypress/e2e/emulation.cy.ts`.
  - Create dedicated verification suite `scripts/verify-android-share-e2e.ts`, register `npm run test:android-share-e2e` in `package.json`, and update `docs/files.md`.

- [x] **Subtask 53.2: Emulator Screencast Video Recording, Artifact Staging & Report Presentation**:
  - Configure Android emulator workflow (`.github/workflows/emulation.yml`) and runner script (`scripts/run-android-e2e.sh`) to record a video screencast of the E2E test running on the emulator via `adb shell screenrecord`.
  - Pull and stage `android-emulator-video.mp4` as a workflow artifact and onto the `gh-pages` branch (`screenshots/android-emulator-video.mp4`), keeping the video ephemeral and ignored on the `main` branch as required by AGENTS.md.
  - Update `public/android-emulator-report.html` to embed and present the screencast video player (`<video controls autoplay muted loop>`) alongside the test steps, captured screenshots, Mochawesome report, Playwright report, and logcat telemetry.
  - Create dedicated verification suite `scripts/verify-emulator-screencast-report.ts`, register in `package.json`, and update `docs/files.md`.

## Task 54: Improve Android Device & Emulator E2E Testing Suite

- [x] **Subtask 54.1: Robust Device Environment, Lifecycle Management & Telemetry**:
  - Add explicit device serial selection (`adb -s <serial>`) to ensure stability across both physical hardware devices and emulators.
  - Implement screen wake, keyguard dismissal (`wm dismiss-keyguard`), device orientation locking, and battery/network health checks before test execution.
  - Collect rich hardware and system telemetry (Manufacturer, Model, Android Version, API Level, Display Resolution, Density, Architecture) and include it in the test summary and `public/android-emulator-report.html`.
  - Add dedicated verification suite `scripts/verify-android-device-e2e-suite.ts` and register `test:android-device-e2e` in `package.json`.

- [ ] **Subtask 54.2: Adaptive Device Interaction, Live Intent Assertions & Multi-Scenario Video Capture**:
  - Add adaptive coordinate scaling based on device display resolution for gestures and taps.
  - Implement real device live intent dispatch (`ACTION_VIEW` and `ACTION_SEND`) with verification of UI response in `scripts/android-e2e-assert.sh`.
  - Ensure video screencast recording and screenshot generation dynamically handle physical device screens and rotation gracefully.
  - Update `e2e/emulation.spec.ts` and Cypress emulation tests to reflect physical device and emulator parity.

  - Strictly maintain `hl=en` to keep menus in English, force captions via `cc_load_policy=1`, and control subtitle languages via `cc_lang_pref`.
  - Track subtitle requests in `networkTracker` (`/api/timedtext?...&fmt=json3`) and provide direct links to view them in the embedded Network Requests Inspector.
  - Implement dedicated test `scripts/verify-language-video-player-accordion.ts` and register `npm run test:language-player-accordion`.

## Task 56: Fix autoSpeakOnFetch ReferenceError Initialization Order

- [x] **Subtask 56.1: Initialize autoSpeakOnFetch Prior to Callback Bindings**:

## Task 58: Auto-Enable "Speak" Checkbox on Favorites Language Panel Upon Subtitle Fetching

- [x] **Subtask 58.1: Auto-check "Speak" checkbox when favorite language subtitles are fetched and remove pronouncing language name**:
  - Remove pronouncing the language's name (e.g. `speak(meta.name)`) via TTS upon subtitle fetch in `src/routes/index.tsx` and related components.
  - When `autoSpeakOnFetch` is enabled and subtitles are fetched/loaded for language(s), automatically add those languages to `spoken` state (checking the checkbox under "Speak" in the Favorites Language panel).
  - Update `scripts/verify-auto-speak-on-fetch.ts` and related tests to validate that fetching subtitles automatically sets the "Speak" checkbox without pronouncing language names.
  - Run dedicated tests, verify app compilation (`compile_applet`) and linting (`lint_applet`), and perform dedicated git commit.

- [ ] 59.2 Accordions auto-fold after a timeout unless pinned.
- [ ] 59.3 Subtitles always belong to the current video (no fixture/stale captions on Android or other videos).
- [ ] 59.4 Remove the iframe player option.
- [ ] 59.5 Library record: "Clear cache" and "Fetch from scratch" buttons.
- [ ] 59.6 Removing a favorite language removes all related instances (columns, speech, players, cached state).

## Task 60: Fix Android App Loading Failure & Restore Robust Android Shell Execution

- [x] **Subtask 60.1: Fix Kotlin Compilation Syntax Errors, Clean Query Suffix Handling & Restore Clean Android App Loading**:
  - Replace illegal `catch (_: Exception)` syntax with valid `catch (e: Exception)` / `catch (ignored: Exception)` across `MainActivity.kt` to fix Kotlin 1.9 compiler failure.
  - Fix `buildQuerySuffix` and intent handling to cleanly load local assets `index.html` without corrupt query combinations or unnecessary whole-page reloads on `onNewIntent`.
  - Fix `onNewIntent` to prevent unintended `webView.loadUrl` reloads when `evaluateJavascript` returns null.
  - Ensure proactive subtitle detection does not overwrite `lastObservedTimedTextUrl` with hardcoded Hebrew or inject mismatched captions on video load.
  - Create dedicated verification test `scripts/verify-android-app-loading.ts` and register `npm run test:android-loading` in `package.json`.
  - Verify app compilation, linting, run tests, and perform git commit.

## Task 61: Resolve Android App Runtime Failure After Commit Group 420d2bd-b92be574

- [x] **Subtask 61.1: Ensure Clean Asset Synchronization, Gradle Asset Build Integrity & Android Shell Runtime Stability**:
  - Synchronize bundled web assets in `android-shell/app/src/main/assets/` directly with current production build outputs (`dist/`), preventing missing hash chunk errors.
  - Fix `android-shell/app/build.gradle.kts` `prepareWebAssets` task to always refresh bundled assets instead of skipping when stale `index.html` exists.
  - Verify Android WebView asset interception in `MainActivity.kt` serves bundled JS/CSS chunks reliably with correct MIME types and headers.
  - Validate that all UI features added in commit group `420d2bd-b92be574` (compact accordion headers, pin toggles, TTS voice selections) initialize safely without browser/WebView runtime errors.
  - Create dedicated verification test `scripts/verify-android-app-run-parity.ts` and register `npm run test:android-run-parity` in `package.json`.
  - Verify app compilation, linting, run tests, and perform git commit.

## Task 62: Fix Android App "This page didn't load" Error & Enforce Emulator E2E Failure

- [x] **Subtask 62.1: Enforce Emulator E2E Failure on Android Error Pages ("This page didn't load")**:
  - Update Android emulator E2E assertion scripts (`scripts/android-e2e-assert.sh`, `scripts/run-android-e2e.sh`, `e2e/emulation.spec.ts`, `cypress/e2e/emulation.cy.ts`) to explicitly check for error texts such as "This page didn't load", "Something went wrong on our end", and "Try again".
  - Ensure the E2E test fails immediately if the webview or emulator screen shows this error screen or fails to load the real application root.
  - Create dedicated verification test `scripts/verify-emulator-error-detection.ts`, register in `package.json`, and update `docs/files.md`.
  - Verify tests, compilation, linting, and perform dedicated git commit.

- [ ] **Subtask 62.2: Identify Root Cause in Commit Range 420d2bd..b92be574 & Fix Android App Loading**:
  - Analyze commit diffs across `420d2bd..b92be574` to identify why the Android app loads the error page ("This page didn't load").
  - Fix `MainActivity.kt`, URL loading, routing, or asset loading to ensure the Android app successfully loads the local web assets.
  - Verify with dedicated verification test, run compilation, linting, and perform dedicated git commit and push.
