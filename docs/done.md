## Task 62: Fix Android App "This page didn't load" Error & Enforce Emulator E2E Failure

### Subtask 62.1: Enforce Emulator E2E Failure on Android Error Pages ("This page didn't load")

- Updated Android emulator E2E assertion scripts (`scripts/android-e2e-assert.sh`, `scripts/run-android-e2e.sh`, `e2e/emulation.spec.ts`, `cypress/e2e/emulation.cy.ts`) to explicitly check for error markers including "This page didn't load", "Something went wrong on our end", `router-error-component`, and `APP_PAGE_ERROR`.
- Updated `src/routes/__root.tsx` ErrorComponent to include unambiguous diagnostic tags (`data-testid="router-error-component"`, `data-testid="router-error-title"`, `[APP_BOOT_ERROR]`, `[APP_PAGE_ERROR]`).
- Updated `src/client.tsx` to detect router error boundary rendering and halt `[APP_READY]` signaling so emulator tests fail immediately.
- Implemented periodic `uiautomator dump` in `scripts/android-e2e-assert.sh` to ensure the on-device UI display fails tests if the error screen is visible.
- Created dedicated verification test `scripts/verify-emulator-error-detection.ts` (`npm run test:emulator-error-detection`), registered in `package.json`, and documented in `docs/files.md`.
- Verified clean build (`compile_applet`) and zero ESLint errors (`lint_applet`).

## Task 61: Resolve Android App Runtime Failure After Commit Group 420d2bd-b92be574

### Subtask 61.1: Ensure Clean Asset Synchronization, Gradle Asset Build Integrity & Android Shell Runtime Stability

- Synchronized bundled web assets in `android-shell/app/src/main/assets/` directly with current production build outputs (`dist/`), preventing missing hash chunk errors and 404s in the WebView.
- Fixed code formatting and linting errors across `src/lib/playback-preferences.ts` and `src/routes/index.tsx` introduced by recent UI commits.
- Verified Android WebView asset interception and fallback mechanisms in `MainActivity.kt` cleanly serve bundled JS/CSS chunks with correct MIME types without logging premature errors.
- Validated that all compact accordion headers, pin toggles, and TTS voice selection features initialize safely without throwing runtime errors.
- Created dedicated verification test `scripts/verify-android-app-run-parity.ts` (`npm run test:android-run-parity`), registered in `package.json`, and documented in `docs/files.md`.
- Verified 100% test pass rate across all suites, clean app compilation (`compile_applet`), and zero ESLint errors (`lint_applet`).

## Task 60: Fix Android App Loading Failure & Restore Robust Android Shell Execution

### Subtask 60.1: Fix Kotlin Compilation Syntax Errors, Clean Query Suffix Handling & Restore Clean Android App Loading

- Replaced invalid `catch (_: Exception)` with valid `catch (ignored: Exception)` across `MainActivity.kt`, fixing Kotlin 1.9 compiler failure.
- Fixed `buildQuerySuffix` and intent handling to cleanly load local assets `index.html` without corrupt query combinations (`"null"`, `"undefined"`) or unnecessary whole-page reloads on `onNewIntent`.
- Fixed `onNewIntent` to seamlessly dispatch incoming video IDs via `window.onNativeSharedLinkReceived` or buffer in `window.__pendingSharedLink` without destructive `window.location.href` or `loadUrl` reloads.
- Removed premature hardcoded Hebrew fallback and subtitle injection from `proactiveDetectSubtitles` and `onCreate`, ensuring `lastObservedTimedTextUrl` is never corrupted and subtitles always strictly match the active video.
- Removed premature `Asset not found` error logging in `shouldInterceptRequest` before attempting extensionless SPA route and `assetLoader` fallbacks.
- Created dedicated verification test `scripts/verify-android-app-loading.ts` (`npm run test:android-loading`), registered in `package.json`, and documented in `docs/files.md`.
- Verified 100% test pass rate across all suites, clean app compilation (`compile_applet`), and zero ESLint errors (`lint_applet`).

## Task 58: Auto-Enable "Speak" Checkbox on Favorites Language Panel Upon Subtitle Fetching

### Subtask 58.1: Auto-check "Speak" checkbox when favorite language subtitles are fetched and remove pronouncing language name

- Removed audio pronunciation of language names (`speak(meta.name)`) via TTS upon subtitle fetch in `src/routes/index.tsx` and related components.
- Configured `autoSpeakOnFetch` so that when subtitle tracks are fetched/loaded for language(s), the language(s) are automatically added to `spoken` state (`setSpoken`), setting the checkbox under "Speak" on the Favorites Language panel.
- Updated the toggle explanation copy in the Favorites Language panel to clarify that it automatically enables the "Speak" checkbox when subtitles are loaded.
- Updated `scripts/verify-auto-speak-on-fetch.ts` to assert that language names are not spoken and that the "Speak" checkbox state is auto-checked on fetch.
- Verified all tests pass, app compiles cleanly (`compile_applet`), and ESLint passes with 0 errors.

## Task 57: Remove Textual Color Names from Accordion Header Bars

### Subtask 57.1: Remove Color Names Text from Accordion Section Headers

- Removed rendered textual color names (`theme.tagColor`) from `AccordionSection` header bars in `src/routes/index.tsx`.
- Replaced textual color badge with subtle dot accent indicator (`theme.dotBg`) and retained full constant color bar styling (`border-l-4`, summary tinted background).
- Updated `src/config/accordionThemes.ts` and `scripts/verify-accordion-colors.ts` to assert that textual color names are completely removed while constant color themes and attributes are preserved.
- Verified 100% test pass rate (`npm run test:accordion-colors`), clean app compilation, and zero ESLint warnings.

## Task 56: Fix autoSpeakOnFetch ReferenceError Initialization Order

### Subtask 56.1: Initialize autoSpeakOnFetch Prior to Callback Bindings

- Reordered `autoSpeakOnFetch` state initialization in `src/routes/index.tsx` above all callbacks (`fetchFavoriteLanguageSubtitles`, `onSelectLanguage`) that reference it, eliminating temporal dead zone (TDZ) ReferenceError on component render.
- Created dedicated verification test suite `scripts/verify-autospeak-initialization-order.ts` asserting top-level declaration order and zero downstream duplicate re-declarations.
- Registered `"test:autospeak-init"` in `package.json` and documented in `docs/files.md`.
- Verified 100% test pass rate, clean app compilation, and zero ESLint warnings.

## Task 55: Accordion Color Standardization, Auto-TTS Subtitle Fetching, Touch-Friendly Language Selection & Multi-Language Video Player

### Subtask 55.1: Constant Theme Colors per Accordion Type
- Created `src/config/accordionThemes.ts` defining distinct constant color themes (borders, summary backgrounds, badges, and tags) for each accordion section (`player`, `playback`, `parser`, `languages`, `language-player`, `subtitles`, `library`).
- Updated `AccordionSection` to apply `data-accordion-type`, `data-accordion-color`, `data-testid="accordion-bar-{id}"`, and colored header bars.
- Implemented dedicated test `scripts/verify-accordion-colors.ts` and registered `npm run test:accordion-colors`.

### Subtask 55.2: Automatic Speech Synthesis Announcement on Subtitle Fetch
- Added persistent configuration `getAutoSpeakOnFetchSetting` and `setAutoSpeakOnFetchSetting` in `src/utils/appSettings.ts` (defaulting to enabled/`true`).
- Triggered automatic pronunciation of language names via TTS (`speak`) upon live fetch completion, base64 caption interception, and language selection.
- Added accessible toggle `data-testid="auto-speak-on-fetch-toggle"` in the Languages panel.
- Implemented dedicated test `scripts/verify-auto-speak-on-fetch.ts` and registered `npm run test:auto-speak-on-fetch`.

### Subtask 55.3: Touch-Friendly Language Boxes & Keep Clicked Selections on Top
- Created `src/components/LanguageBoxesSelector.tsx` featuring a mode toggle button (`#toggle-language-display-mode`) between boxes and list.
- Provided large touch-friendly box elements (`min-h-[48px]`, `data-testid="language-box-{code}"`) suitable for Android.
- Automatically partitioned and kept selected/clicked languages at the top of the grid and table (`orderedLangs`).
- Maintained compatibility and synchronization with `#target-language-select` for all existing automation suites.

### Subtask 55.4: Dedicated Language Video Player Accordion with Iframe URL Subtitle Control & Network Inspector Integration
- Registered `"language-player"` accordion panel (`"Language video player"`) in `PANELS` and `panelOrder`.
- Created `src/components/LanguageVideoPlayerPanel.tsx` rendering YouTube embed iframes with `https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID?hl=en&cc_load_policy=1&cc_lang_pref={lang}`.
- Strictly maintained `hl=en` to keep menus in English, forced captions via `cc_load_policy=1`, and controlled subtitle languages via `cc_lang_pref`.
- Tracked subtitle requests in `networkTracker` (`/api/timedtext?...&fmt=json3`) and provided direct links to view them in the embedded Network Requests Inspector.
- Implemented dedicated test `scripts/verify-language-video-player-accordion.ts` and registered `npm run test:language-player-accordion`.

## Task 54: Improve Android Device & Emulator E2E Testing Suite

### Subtask 54.1: Robust Device Environment, Lifecycle Management & Telemetry

- Supported explicit device targeting with `ANDROID_SERIAL` across `scripts/run-android-e2e.sh` and `scripts/android-e2e-assert.sh`, including automatic discovery of first connected device/emulator when omitted.
- Wrapped adb interactions in an `adb_cmd` function with `-s "$ANDROID_SERIAL"` for multi-device isolation.
- Implemented automated device wake (`input keyevent KEYCODE_WAKEUP`), keyguard dismissal (`wm dismiss-keyguard`), orientation locking (`accelerometer_rotation 0`), and battery/device connectivity logging.
- Extracted comprehensive hardware and software telemetry (model, brand, manufacturer, release, SDK/API level, display size, display density, CPU ABI, battery level) and saved to `android-emulator-device-info.json`.
- Enforced clean repository hygiene by adding `android-emulator-device-info.json` to `.gitignore`.
- Updated `public/android-emulator-report.html` to dynamically hydrate a "Device & Hardware Telemetry" dashboard section from the JSON payload with graceful fallbacks.

- Documented `scripts/verify-android-device-e2e-suite.ts` in `docs/files.md`.
- Verified 100% test pass rate, clean compilation, and zero ESLint warnings.

## Task 53: Android E2E YouTube Share Intent Verification, Screencast Video Recording & GitHub Pages Presentation

### Subtask 53.1: Android E2E YouTube Link Share Testing (Browser & Official YouTube App)

- Implemented comprehensive E2E tests validating that YouTube links shared from either:
  1. A web browser (via `ACTION_VIEW` with standard watch URLs `watch?v=...`, query parameters like `&t=42s`, shortened `youtu.be/...`, `?si=...`, mobile `m.youtube.com`, YouTube Shorts, embeds, and live streams).
  2. The official YouTube app (via `ACTION_SEND` with plain URLs or prefixed sharing text like `"Check out this video on YouTube: https://youtu.be/..."`).
- Validated that `MainActivity.kt` and WebView bridge (`window.onNativeSharedLinkReceived`) cleanly switch to the shared video, reset state, clear cached timedtext, and initiate caption discovery without crashing or reloading the entire webview session.
- Added browser and YouTube app sharing test cases to `e2e/emulation.spec.ts` and `cypress/e2e/emulation.cy.ts`.
- Created dedicated verification test suite `scripts/verify-android-share-e2e.ts` covering 16 comprehensive verification checks across intent formats, URL extraction, query parameter parsing, and native-to-web messaging.
- Registered `"test:android-share-e2e"` script in `package.json` and documented in `docs/files.md`.
- Verified all 16 test assertions pass cleanly (`npm run test:android-share-e2e`), app compiles (`npm run build`), and ESLint passes with 0 warnings.

### Subtask 53.2: Emulator Screencast Video Recording, Artifact Staging & Report Presentation

- Configured screencast video recording on Android emulator via `adb shell screenrecord /sdcard/android-emulator-video.mp4` in both `scripts/run-android-e2e.sh` and `.github/workflows/emulation.yml`.
- Implemented clean termination signaling with `SIGINT` / `kill -2` to finalize the MP4 container before pulling the recorded video with `adb pull /sdcard/android-emulator-video.mp4`.
- Updated `.gitignore` to strictly ignore `*.mp4`, `android-emulator-video.mp4`, and `public/screenshots/android-emulator-video.mp4` to preserve clean repository hygiene on the `main` branch.
- Updated `.github/workflows/emulation.yml` to stage the video into `gh-pages-staging/screenshots/android-emulator-video.mp4` and upload as a workflow artifact (`android-emulator-screencast-video`), ensuring it is published to GitHub Pages without ever being committed to `main`.
- Embedded an interactive video player presentation card (`<video controls autoplay muted loop>`) in `public/android-emulator-report.html` alongside the step-by-step screenshots, logcat telemetry, and test reports.
- Created dedicated verification test suite `scripts/verify-emulator-screencast-report.ts`, registered `"test:emulator-screencast-report"` in `package.json`, and documented in `docs/files.md`.
- Verified 100% test pass rate across all dedicated test suites, successful app compilation, and zero lint warnings.

## Task 52: Emulator E2E Subtitles Detection & Inspection with YouTube API Fallback, and Empty/Non-JSON Cache Guard Test

### Subtask 52.1: Add Test Ensuring the App Doesn't Cache Empty Response or Non-JSON Response

- Created comprehensive dedicated test suite `scripts/verify-no-cache-empty-or-non-json.ts` testing 22 invalid/empty payload vectors across `isValidJsonSubtitleResponse`, `saveCachedRawJson3`, `saveCachedSubtitles`, and `saveCachedTargetSubtitles`.
- Asserted rejection of empty strings (`""`), blank whitespace (`"   \n\t "`), `null`, `undefined`, empty arrays, and empty objects.
- Asserted rejection of non-JSON responses including HTML 404/500 error pages, plaintext error strings, rate limit messages, XML error payloads, malformed JSON, and JSON without text cues.
- Verified cache write protection: attempting to cache empty or non-JSON responses leaves storage untouched, and existing valid cached subtitles and raw JSON3 are preserved and never overwritten by subsequent empty or corrupt responses.
- Verified Android native shell (`MainActivity.kt`) contracts: `isValidJsonSubtitle` validation, `saveCaptionToFile` disk write protection, and interception checking.
- Registered `"test:no-cache-empty-non-json"` in `package.json` and documented in `docs/files.md`.

### Subtask 52.2: Implement Emulator E2E Testing Default Subtitles Detection, Favorite Languages Fetch, YouTube API tlang/lang Fallback, and Network & Subtitles View Inspection

- Implemented full emulator E2E flow in `e2e/emulation.spec.ts` and `cypress/e2e/emulation.cy.ts` covering:
  1. Default subtitles detection: native timedtext interception receiving base subtitle stream.
  2. Favorite languages proactive fetching: automatic requests for favorite languages (Hebrew and Italian) following default caption discovery.
  3. YouTube API tlang and lang fallback: simulated invalid response on primary `tlang` request automatically triggering the fallback `lang` request which succeeds with valid JSON3 dialogue.
  4. Network Panel inspection: opening `#network-inspector-modal`, inspecting tracked requests, verifying `tlang` tag, `lang` fallback tag, HTTP status, and response body previews.
  5. Subtitles view inspection: asserting parallel subtitles table renders columns for default and favorite languages with synchronized dialogue text.
  6. Per-step screenshot captures (`step1-default-subtitles-detected`, `step2-favorite-languages-fetch`, `step3-youtube-api-tlang-lang-fallback`, `step4-network-panel-inspection`, `step5-subtitles-view-inspection`).
- Enhanced `public/android-emulator-report.html` for GitHub Pages publication with step-by-step verification cards, status badges, step screenshots, and logcat telemetry.
- Created dedicated verification test suite `scripts/verify-emulator-e2e-subtitles.ts` (`npm run test:emulator-subtitles-e2e`), registered in `package.json`, and documented in `docs/files.md`.
- Verified 100% pass across all regression test suites, app compilation, and 0 lint warnings.

## Task 41: Video library panel (watch history)

### Subtask 41.1: Implement Video Library / Watch History Panel

- Implemented `src/utils/videoLibraryManager.ts` providing persistent watch history management (`loadVideoLibrary`, `saveVideoLibrary`, `recordVideoWatch`, `removeVideoFromLibrary`, `clearVideoLibrary`) backed by `STORAGE_KEYS.LIBRARY_STORAGE_KEY` with fallback to `DEFAULT_LIBRARY_ITEMS`.
- Created `src/components/VideoLibraryPanel.tsx` with searchable video cards, high-quality thumbnails (`getVideoThumbnailUrl`), relative watch timestamps (`formatRelativeTime`), quick video selection/load button (`data-testid="library-play-btn"`), currently active indicator badge, individual remove buttons (`data-testid="library-remove-btn"`), and clear library confirmation (`data-testid="library-clear-btn"`).
- Integrated the Video Library panel into `PANELS` accordion in `src/routes/index.tsx` (`id: "library", title: "Video library"`), allowing users to browse their history and instantly switch videos directly from the sidebar.
- Added automatic watch history recording (`recordVideoWatch`) in `src/routes/index.tsx` whenever a video ID is loaded or played, updating recent watch timestamps and deduplicating items to keep recent items at the top.
- Created dedicated verification test suite `scripts/verify-video-library.ts` (`npm run test:video-library`), registered in `package.json`, and documented in `docs/files.md`.
- Verified all verification suites (`test:video-library`, `test:audio-track-time-sections`, `test:multi-video-audio-sync`), compile check, and ESLint pass with 0 errors and 0 warnings.

## Task 51: Fix Original Video Repeating Same Time-Frame and Not Respecting Subtitle Time-Sections in Audio-Track Mode

### Subtask 51.1: Audio-Track Mode Loop Progression & Accurate Time-Section Resumption

- Replaced the flawed `idx >= 0 && rows[idx]?.start ? rows[idx].start / 1000 : ...` resume target logic in `src/routes/index.tsx`. When section `candidateRow` completes and audio-track repetition finishes, playback advances strictly to `rows[candidateRow + 1].start / 1000` (or cleanly pauses if reaching the final subtitle row). This eliminates the bug where the original video element repeated the same section before proceeding.
- Added audio-track fallback in `getEligibleLangs` in `src/routes/index.tsx`: when `audioTrackMode` is enabled and no explicit spoken languages are selected, it falls back to the default base language (`baseLanguage` / `primary`), ensuring that subtitle time-sections are respected, paused, and repeated using the original video's native audio even with no secondary languages enabled.
- Added pre-seek guard (`hasStartedNearStart`) in `executeMultiVideoSegmentSync` in `src/utils/multiVideoPlayerManager.ts`, confirming the player has completed its asynchronous seek near `startMs` before allowing `currentMs >= endMs - 50` completion checks.
- Cleared row index `i` from `playedTtsRecords` in `seek(r, i)` in `src/routes/index.tsx`, ensuring clicking any row resets its played state and allows it to repeat and play cleanly.
- Implemented dedicated verification test suite `scripts/verify-audio-track-time-sections.ts` (`npm run test:audio-track-time-sections`) validating section progression, elimination of duplicate replaying, pre-seek guarding, language fallback, and replayability. Registered script in `package.json` and documented in `docs/files.md`.
- Verified all regression test suites, app compilation, and ESLint pass with 0 errors and 0 warnings.

## Task 50: Draggable Floating Setup Pause Button with Autofocus, Auto-scroll & Play-Switch Suppression

### Subtask 50.1: Draggable Floating Pause Component & Drag Handling

- Created `src/components/FloatingDraggablePauseButton.tsx` with fixed viewport positioning and z-index priority.
- Implemented smooth side-to-side dragging via both touch (`onTouchStart`, `onTouchMove`, `onTouchEnd`) and mouse (`onMouseDown`, `mousemove`, `mouseup`) with dynamic viewport clamping.
- Implemented tap-vs-drag discrimination (`hasMovedRef`) preventing accidental toggle clicks when releasing a drag.
- Added visual feedback with distinct setup pause badge ("Autoscroll & Play OFF"), pause/play icons, responsive grab/grabbing cursors, and local storage coordinate persistence (`yt_floating_pause_pos`).
- Created dedicated verification suite `scripts/verify-floating-draggable-pause.ts` and registered in `package.json`.

### Subtask 50.2: Player Coordination & Autofocus / Auto-scroll / Play-Switch Suppression

- Integrated `FloatingDraggablePauseButton` into `src/routes/index.tsx` root view with `isSetupPaused` state and `toggleSetupPause` handler.
- When setup pause is engaged, all media players (`multiVideoPlayerRegistry.pauseAllExcept()`, `player.current.pauseVideo()`) are instantly paused and active speech synthesis (`cancelSpeech()`) is cancelled.
- Completely suppressed playback interval loop (`st.current.isSetupPaused`), preventing automatic subtitle cue progression, play-switching, and seeking.
- Completely suppressed subtitle table row auto-scroll (`scrollIntoView`) and Android pagination autoFocus during setup pause.
- Updated and verified dedicated test suite `scripts/verify-floating-draggable-pause.ts` (`npm run test:floating-pause`).

## Task 48: Fix APK Version Collision, Update Script Robustness & In-App Version Display with Releases Link

### Subtask 48.1: Robust APK Installation & Version Code Handling in Update Script

- Updated `update.apk.sh` and `install-apk.sh` with `deep_purge_package` (`am force-stop`, `pm clear`, `adb uninstall`, `pm uninstall --user 0`) ensuring total cleanup of colliding packages or lingering corrupted data.
- Added `has_collision_error` detecting signature and package conflicts (`INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE`, `INSTALL_FAILED_VERSION_DOWNGRADE`, `INSTALL_FAILED_CONFLICTING_PROVIDER`, `INSTALL_FAILED_SHARED_USER_INCOMPATIBLE`, `INSTALL_FAILED_DUPLICATE_PERMISSION`) with automatic deep purge and re-installation.
- Configured standard semantic version (`"version": "1.0.16"`) in `package.json`.
- Propagated `appVersionCode` and `appVersionName` via `.github/workflows/release-apk.yml` into Gradle `assembleDebug`.
- Added direct link to GitHub all releases page in `README.md`.
- Created dedicated verification suite `scripts/verify-apk-installation-robustness.ts` and registered in `package.json`.

### Subtask 48.2: In-App Version Display with Link to All Releases Page

- Defined canonical constants `APP_VERSION = "1.0.16"` and `ALL_RELEASES_URL = "https://github.com/mostuf2556/subtitle-sync/releases"` in `src/config/appConfig.ts` and aligned `CURRENT_APK_VERSION = "v1.0.16"` in `src/utils/apkUpdater.ts`.
- Added header version badge `v1.0.16` (`data-testid="header-app-version-badge"`) linking to GitHub all releases page.
- Added footer link `All Releases (v1.0.16)` (`data-testid="footer-all-releases-link"`) linking to GitHub all releases page.
- Updated `ApkReleaseModal` with direct link to all releases (`data-testid="modal-all-releases-link"`).
- Created dedicated verification suite `scripts/verify-apk-version-and-releases.ts` and registered in `package.json`.

## Task 49: Multi-Instance Video Elements with Independent Audio-Track Configuration & Horizontal Swiper Synchronization

### Subtask 49.1: Multi-Instance Video Player State & Independent Configuration Architecture

- Built `src/utils/multiVideoPlayerManager.ts` to manage multiple video player instances mapped by language code: primary video plus dedicated instances for each language with speak/audio enabled.
- Implemented isolated local storage persistence (`yt_multi_instance_{videoId}_configs`) and independent state management per video element instance (volume, mute, manual audio track configured status, label) so setting audio track or volume in one instance never leaks to others.
- Implemented `MultiVideoPlayerRegistry` for multi-instance coordination (`pauseAllExcept`, `unmuteOnly`, `syncSecondaryPlayers`, `register`, `unregister`).
- Created dedicated verification suite `scripts/verify-multi-video-player-state.ts`.

### Subtask 49.2: Horizontal Swiper Carousel Component for Multi-Video Elements

- Created `src/components/VideoInstancesSwiper.tsx` providing a smooth horizontal swipeable carousel with touch gestures (`onTouchStart`, `onTouchMove`, `onTouchEnd`) and desktop controls (`ChevronLeft`, `ChevronRight`).
- Implemented slide indicators, language headers (Primary vs Spoken Languages), and active playback indicator badges (`Active Audio`).
- Integrated independent YouTube audio track setup guidance and isolated per-instance toggle persistence (`Mark Configured` / `Track Configured`).
- Integrated `VideoInstancesSwiper` into `src/routes/index.tsx` player panel.
- Created dedicated verification suite `scripts/verify-video-instances-swiper.ts` and registered in `package.json`.

### Subtask 49.3: Multi-Video Pause/Resume Audio-Track Synchronization Loop

- Implemented `executeMultiVideoSegmentSync` in `src/utils/multiVideoPlayerManager.ts` to coordinate pause/resume and unmuting across multi-video player instances during subtitle cue intervals.
- Pauses all other player instances and unmutes exclusively the active speaking language instance during segment repetition.
- Emits real-time progress callbacks for subtitle highlighting, and automatically pauses target player and restores unmuted state to primary upon completion or cancellation.
- Integrated `executeMultiVideoSegmentSync` into `speakRow` in `src/routes/index.tsx` with smooth fallback to Web Speech TTS when `audioTrackMode` is disabled.
- Synchronized primary player resumption with registry state (`unmuteOnly("primary")`) and cancellation cleanup.
- Created dedicated verification suite `scripts/verify-multi-video-audio-sync.ts` and registered in `package.json`.

## Task 47: Fix README.md Links, CI Workflows & GitHub Pages Staging for Forked Repositories

### Subtask 47.1: Synchronize README.md Links & Static Fallbacks for Current and Forked Repositories

- Created `public/android-emulator-report.html` and unignored it in `.gitignore` so that when `npm run build` runs, Vite automatically places `android-emulator-report.html` into `dist/`. This ensures GitHub Pages never serves a 404 for the emulator report even before the macOS emulator runner executes.
- Updated `.github/workflows/update-readme.yml` by removing path filters, ensuring that any push to `main` or `master` on a fork automatically triggers identity synchronization for `README.md` to match the fork's owner and repo.
- Verified `scripts/update-readme.mjs` cleanly rewrites badge links, workflow links, raw curl update commands, and GitHub Pages demo & report URLs when switching between owners and repositories.
- Created dedicated verification suite `scripts/verify-fork-readme-links.ts` (`npm run test:fork-readme-links`).
- Registered `test:fork-readme-links` in `package.json` and documented in `docs/files.md`.

### Subtask 47.2: Ensure GitHub Actions E2E Tests Pass and Deploy to GitHub Pages on Forked Repos

- Added `push: branches: [main, master]` triggers to `.github/workflows/web.yml` and `.github/workflows/emulation.yml` in addition to `workflow_run`, enabling forked repositories to automatically execute test pipelines and publish reports to `gh-pages`.
- Configured resilient artifact deployment across `web.yml`, `deploy-demo.yml`, and `emulation.yml` ensuring all test outputs (`mochawesome.html`, `playwright/`, `android-emulator-report.html`, `screenshots/`) deploy to `gh-pages` with `keep_files: true`.
- Created dedicated verification test `scripts/verify-fork-ci-workflows.ts` (`npm run test:fork-ci-workflows`) and validated all workflow triggers and deployment configurations.

## Task 46: Fix E2E Report Generation, CI Workflows & GitHub Pages Staging

### Subtask 46.1: Fix Playwright E2E Locator Ambiguity

- Updated `src/routes/index.tsx` so all collapsible `<details>` panels emit unambiguous `data-panel="{title}"` attributes (e.g. `data-panel="languages"`).
- Updated `e2e/web.spec.ts` and `e2e/app.spec.ts` to disambiguate the Languages panel locators using `details.filter({ has: page.locator("summary", { hasText: "Languages" }) })`, preventing strict-mode collisions with subtitle criteria description text in the Parser panel.
- Created dedicated verification test `scripts/verify-playwright-locators.ts` (`npm run test:playwright-locators`).
- Registered `test:playwright-locators` in `package.json` and documented in `docs/files.md`.
- Verified all 5 tests in `e2e/web.spec.ts` and the smoke test in `e2e/app.spec.ts` pass cleanly.
- Verified app compilation and lint.

### Subtask 46.2: Fix `emulation.yml` Syntax and Report Generation

- Fixed YAML syntax and multi-line escaping in `.github/workflows/emulation.yml` using Node.js script generation within the YAML block scalar.
- Added `if: always() && ...` to the GitHub Pages deployment step in `emulation.yml`, guaranteeing emulator report and screenshot publication to `gh-pages` even during partial test triage or failure.
- Updated `scripts/verify-emulation-gh-pages.ts` to validate workflow YAML syntax via `js-yaml` and verify resilient report deployment.
- Verified all 6 workflow files in `.github/workflows/` pass `js-yaml` parsing with 0 errors.

### Subtask 46.3: Ensure Guaranteed E2E Report Staging on GitHub Pages

- Added `if: always() && ...` to `Deploy Web Test Outputs to GitHub Pages (gh-pages)` in `.github/workflows/web.yml`, ensuring Mochawesome (`mochawesome.html`) and Playwright (`playwright/index.html`) reports publish to `gh-pages` even during test failures or triages.
- Added `Stage E2E Reports into Web Distribution` step to `.github/workflows/deploy-demo.yml`, preserving and staging `mochawesome.html`, `playwright/`, `android-emulator-report.html`, and `screenshots/` into `./dist` prior to web demo deployment.
- Updated and passed dedicated verification test `scripts/verify-e2e-report-links.ts` (`npm run test:e2e-report-links`).
- Unignored `!public/screenshots/` in `.gitignore` to preserve authentic emulator screenshots in static bundles.

## Task 45: Accumulative Criteria Subtitles Parser & Inner Group Settings

### Subtask 45.1: E2E Test Report Links in README.md & Verification

- Verified dedicated links in `README.md` to all E2E reports:
  - 📋 Mochawesome Test Report (`mochawesome.html`)
  - 🔍 Playwright E2E Test Report (`playwright/index.html`)
  - 📱 E2E Tests on Android Emulator (`android-emulator-report.html`)
  - 📸 Android Emulator Screenshot (`screenshots/android-emulator-screenshot.png`)
  - 🧪 Web E2E Pipeline CI Runs & Artifacts (`actions/workflows/web.yml`)
  - 🤖 Android Emulator Pipeline CI Runs & Artifacts (`actions/workflows/emulation.yml`)
- Created and passed dedicated verification test `scripts/verify-e2e-report-links.ts` (`npm run test:e2e-report-links`).

### Subtask 45.2: Accumulative Multi-Select Criteria with Inner Group Settings & BiDi Direction Fix

- Refactored `src/lib/subtitles.ts` to support multi-select accumulative criteria (`selectedCriteria: CriteriaId[]`) across:
  - `sentence`: Grammatical sentence endings in base timing language.
  - `pause`: Natural speech silences (>500ms) snapped to subtitle boundaries.

## Task 44 (Hotfix): Verify working links for E2E testing and live web demo & fix GitHub Actions

### Subtask 44.1: Fix GitHub Actions workflows and verify E2E testing & demo links

- Fixed `integrity.yml` workflow failure by restoring authentic emulator screenshot assets in `public/screenshots/android-emulator-screenshot.png` and `public/assets/android-emulator-screenshot.png`, ensuring they are bundled into `dist/` and avoiding 404s on GitHub Pages.
- Cleaned up accidental stray `x` characters in `README.md` header.
- Updated `src/router.tsx` to handle GitHub Pages basepath (`github.io`) and retain trailing slashes, eliminating 404 errors during page reload.
- Initialized `audioTrackMode`, `autoFocus`, and `debugMode` with lazy initializers in `src/routes/index.tsx` to prevent race conditions on page reload.
- Updated `e2e/web.spec.ts` to assert application hydration (`header[data-app-hydrated="true"]`) following `page.reload()`.
- Configured Playwright CI retries (`retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0`) in `playwright.config.ts`.
- Enhanced `scripts/android-e2e-assert.sh` to ensure `android-emulator-screenshot.png` is captured and pulled before exit in `fail()`.
- Implemented dedicated verification test `scripts/verify-hotfix-links-and-actions.ts` (`npm run test:hotfix`), registered script in `package.json`, and documented in `docs/files.md`.
- Verified all regression test suites, app compilation, and linting pass with zero errors.

## Task 43: Validate JSON before caching subtitles and implement auto-fallback between YouTube API options (`tlang` vs `lang`)

### Subtask 43.1: Prevent caching of invalid subtitle responses (ensure answer is valid JSON)

- Added `isValidJsonSubtitle(body: String): Boolean` in `MainActivity.kt` checking that the body is non-blank, parses as valid `JSONObject`, and contains an `events` array with non-empty segment text (`utf8`).
- Guarded `saveCaptionToFile` and the interception handler in `MainActivity.kt`: strictly prevents saving raw caption files to disk (`youtube_captions/`) unless the response is confirmed to be valid JSON with subtitle cues. Updated file extension to `.json`.
- Implemented and exported `isValidJsonSubtitleResponse(data: unknown): boolean` in `src/utils/subtitleCache.ts`, validating YouTube JSON3 `{ events: [...] }` schemas, `CaptionCue[]` arrays, and envelope objects.
- Guarded `saveCachedSubtitles` and `saveCachedTargetSubtitles` to reject invalid cue sets.
- Added `saveCachedRawJson3(videoId, lang, rawJson3)` strictly enforcing that raw cached strings are valid JSON before storing in `localStorage`.
- Created dedicated verification test `scripts/verify-valid-json-cache-guard.ts` (`npm run test:valid-json-cache`), registered in `package.json`, and documented in `docs/files.md`.
- Rebuilt Android web assets with `npm run build:android-assets` and verified all regression suites pass cleanly with 0 lint warnings.

### Subtask 43.2: Implement auto-fallback on invalid response between YouTube API options (`tlang` vs `lang`)

- Updated `executeTimedTextRepetition` in `MainActivity.kt` to dynamically build and test both `tlang` addition and `lang` replacement options, verifying `isValidJsonSubtitle` on each attempt.
- Added automatic fallback in `MainActivity.kt`: if the primary option fails or returns invalid non-JSON data, immediately and automatically attempts the alternative option. If both options fail, returns an empty string without caching corrupt data.
- Enforced `isValidJsonSubtitleResponse(raw)` verification inside the `subtitleRequestModeOrder` mode loop in `fetchFavoriteLanguageSubtitles` in `src/routes/index.tsx`, automatically progressing to the next mode if the first mode yields an invalid response.
- Created dedicated verification test `scripts/verify-subtitle-api-fallback.ts` (`npm run test:subtitle-api-fallback`), registered in `package.json`, and documented in `docs/files.md`.
- Rebuilt Android web assets with `npm run build:android-assets` and verified all 17 regression test suites pass with 0 lint warnings.

## Task 40: Support app history (Android back navigation)

### Subtask 40.1: Implement Android back navigation and router/browser history integration

- Implemented `OnBackPressedCallback` in `MainActivity.kt` providing robust handling for Android device back buttons. Dispatches `window.__handleAndroidBack` to WebView and navigates webview history (`webView.goBack()`) if `canGoBack()` is true before defaulting to system exit.
- In `src/routes/index.tsx`, integrated `popstate` and `window.__handleAndroidBack` handlers allowing users to navigate back through viewed videos, closed panels, and history states without exiting the app.
- Created dedicated verification test `scripts/verify-android-back-navigation.ts` (`npm run test:back-navigation`), registered in `package.json`, and documented in `docs/files.md`.

## Task 39: Allow closing the Network Panel

### Subtask 39.1: Provide explicit close / collapse control on Network Panel

- Enhanced header close button in `src/components/NetworkRequestsInspector.tsx` with explicit identifiers (`id="close-network-inspector-button"`, `data-testid="close-network-inspector-button"`), accessible `aria-label="Close Network Inspector"`, tooltip indicating Escape shortcut, and `onClick={onClose}` handler.
- Implemented global `Escape` keyboard shortcut listener using `useEffect` on `window` (`keydown` -> `onClose()`) with proper event listener cleanup on unmount/close.
- Verified backdrop dismissal on `#network-inspector-modal` (`onClick={onClose}`) with `e.stopPropagation()` on the dialog content card to prevent accidental closing when clicking inside the inspector.
- Added collapse / minimize capability with toggle button (`id="collapse-network-inspector-button"`, `data-testid="collapse-network-inspector-button"`), rendering an unobtrusive compact floating status pill (`#network-inspector-minimized` / `data-testid="network-inspector-minimized"`) with live captured counts, an Expand button (`#expand-network-inspector-button`), and a quick compact close button (`#compact-close-network-inspector-button`).
- Created dedicated verification test `scripts/verify-network-inspector-close.ts` (`npm run test:network-close`), registered in `package.json`, and documented in `docs/files.md`.
- Verified clean build, regression tests, zero lint warnings, and applet compilation.

- Enhanced Network Requests Inspector in `src/components/NetworkRequestsInspector.tsx` with dedicated per-record accordion toggle controls (`record-accordion-toggle-${id}`) and chevron transition animations.
- Implemented `getTlangStatusInfo` computing dynamic status tags and color schemes:
  - Pending: orange/amber (`bg-amber-500/20 text-amber-300 border-amber-500/40`)
  - Done: green (`bg-emerald-500/20 text-emerald-300 border-emerald-500/40`)
  - Failed: red (`bg-red-500/20 text-red-300 border-red-500/40`)
  - Overridden by green on retry success (`retry_success` with green styling)
- Created dedicated verification test `scripts/verify-network-accordion-tags.ts` (`npm run test:accordion-tags`), registered in `package.json`, and documented in `docs/files.md`.
- Rebuilt Android bundled assets with `npm run build:android-assets` and verified all regression suites, lint, and applet compilation.

## Task 37: Clean Network Panel records & add green badge indicator for good fetching

### Subtask 37.1: Exclude empty response bodies from Network Panel and add green badge indicator

- Added and exported `isSuccessfulFetch(req)` in `src/utils/networkTracker.ts`, verifying that only requests with HTTP 200, no error, and a genuine non-empty response body qualify as successful.
- Updated `isFailedRequest` in `NetworkRequestsInspector.tsx` to classify empty response bodies as failed/unsuccessful, ensuring they are excluded by default when `hideFailed` is enabled.
- Preserved accurate HTTP status recording (e.g. 200 OK) while styling empty body responses with warning/failed indicators rather than false green success badges.
- Added green badge indicators (`good-fetch-badge-${tlang}` in list items and `detail-good-fetch-badge` in the detail panel) for successfully fetched language tracks with valid subtitles.
- Created dedicated verification test `scripts/verify-network-clean-records.ts` (`npm run test:clean-network`), registered in `package.json`, and documented in `docs/files.md`.
- Rebuilt Android bundled assets with `npm run build:android-assets` and verified all regression suites, lint, and applet compilation.

## Task 36: Ensure sync between language views with auto-fetch-retry

### Subtask 36.1: Synchronize favorites view, language selection, and subtitles view with auto-fetch-retry

- Ensured in `src/routes/index.tsx` that `cols` unconditionally includes all active favorite languages in `targetLanguages`, guaranteeing that favorite language columns and headers are visible in the subtitles table even while fetching or retrying.
- Added graceful non-blocking loading placeholder `<span className="text-xs text-muted-foreground italic">Loading subtitles…</span>` in table cells for columns whose tracks are pending.
- Implemented automated fetch-retry mechanism with exponential backoff in `fetchFavoriteLanguageSubtitles` tracked by `retriesRef`, resetting on track arrival.
- Added continuous synchronization effect: ensures `shown` contains all `targetLanguages` and triggers auto-fetch-retry for missing favorite tracks until all tracks are aligned.
- Integrated alignment status indicators: `data-testid="subtitles-sync-aligned"` when all favorite tracks are loaded, and `data-testid="subtitles-sync-retrying"` when favorite tracks are being fetched/synced.
- Created dedicated verification test `scripts/verify-favorites-subtitles-sync.ts` (`npm run test:favorites-sync`), registered in `package.json`, and documented in `docs/files.md`.
- Rebuilt Android bundled assets with `npm run build:android-assets` and verified all regression suites, lint, and applet compilation.

## Task 35: Support running Android app in the background

### Subtask 35.1: Configure Android WebView & lifecycle to prevent pausing playback when app is not active

- Configured `android-shell/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` with `android.permission.WAKE_LOCK` and hardware acceleration for continuous background execution.
- In `MainActivity.kt`, maintained `mediaPlaybackRequiresUserGesture = false` and implemented `onPause()` and `onStop()` lifecycles without calling `webView.onPause()` or freezing timers, ensuring media audio and TTS narration continue playing seamlessly when minimized or backgrounded.
- Implemented `onResume()` in `MainActivity.kt` safely resuming WebView and timer execution.
- Injected background playback resilience script in `MainActivity.kt` (`onPageFinished`) and integrated document visibility protection in `src/routes/index.tsx` preventing `visibilitychange` / `document.hidden` from pausing the YouTube player when minimized.
- Created dedicated verification test `scripts/verify-android-background-playback.ts` (`npm run test:background-playback`), registered in `package.json`, and documented in `docs/files.md`.
- Rebuilt Android bundled assets with `npm run build:android-assets` and verified all regression suites, lint, and applet compilation.

## Task 34: Debug mode toggle controlling Network Panel visibility

### Subtask 34.1: Add debug mode toggle (default false) and hide network panel when debug mode is disabled

- Added persistent debug mode configuration in `src/utils/appSettings.ts` (`DEBUG_MODE_STORAGE_KEY = 'yt_debug_mode'`, `getDebugModeSetting`, `setDebugModeSetting`) defaulting strictly to `false` (OFF).
- Added debug mode toggle switch (`#debug-mode-toggle`, `data-testid="debug-mode-toggle"`) in the Controls panel in `src/routes/index.tsx`.
- Controlled Network Panel visibility based on debug mode: when debug mode is disabled (default), the network inspector button (`#open-network-inspector-button`) and the `NetworkRequestsInspector` modal are suppressed and hidden, enabling a clean experience without the network panel.
- Toggling debug mode ON makes the Network Panel button and modal fully accessible.
- Created dedicated verification test `scripts/verify-debug-mode-toggle.ts` (`npm run test:debug-mode`), registered in `package.json`, and documented in `docs/files.md`.
- Verified all regression suites, lint, and applet compilation.

## Task 33: Optimize subtitle loading and fetching performance

### Subtask 33.1: Implement progressive / non-blocking subtitle loading technique

- Integrated `React.useTransition` (`startSubtitlesTransition`, `isSubtitlesPending`) into `src/routes/index.tsx` for non-blocking subtitle track updates.
- Implemented progressive stream loading in `fetchFavoriteLanguageSubtitles`: as each language finishes fetching via the native bridge, it is streamed immediately into `tracks` state inside a transition so users see subtitles appear incrementally.
- Added event loop yielding (`await new Promise<void>((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 0))`) between language requests to prevent UI thread starvation.
- Wrapped live intercepted base64 captions and fixture loading in non-blocking transitions, preserving 60 FPS UI responsiveness and player synchronization.
- Added visual progressive loading indicator (`data-testid="subtitles-progressive-indicator"`) in the subtitles header when `isSubtitlesPending` is active.
- Added dedicated verification test `scripts/verify-progressive-subtitles-loading.ts` (`npm run test:progressive-subtitles`) and validated all performance benchmarks.

## Task 32: Fix YouTube link sharing to Android app

### Subtask 32.1: Fix Android intent handling & WebView URL query propagation for shared YouTube links

- Delegated `parseVideoId` in `src/lib/native-captions.ts` to `extractYouTubeId` (`src/utils/youtube.ts`) supporting all YouTube formats (standard watch URLs, short URLs `youtu.be/`, Shorts, Live, embed links, tracking params, and text with prefixes or video titles).
- Initialized `videoId` state dynamically in `src/routes/index.tsx` from URL search parameters (`v` or `url`) and `window.__pendingSharedLink`, eliminating flashes or sticking to the default video.
- Enabled immediate registration of `window.onNativeSharedLinkReceived` without waiting for `nativeShell()` to attach.
- In `MainActivity.kt`, implemented `extractSharedText`, `extractYouTubeVideoId`, and `buildQuerySuffix` (`?v=$videoId&url=...`), and updated `onNewIntent` to notify `window.onNativeSharedLinkReceived` instantly without destroying the webview session.
- Configured `android:launchMode="singleTask"`, added `text/*` mime type, and added `ACTION_VIEW` intent filter for YouTube domains in `AndroidManifest.xml`.
- Created dedicated verification test `scripts/verify-youtube-share-intent.ts` (`npm run test:youtube-share-intent`) verifying 14 test vectors across all share payloads and architectural contracts.

- Removed manual "Timing from" `<select>` and associated `[pivot, setPivot]` state from `src/routes/index.tsx`.
- Implemented automatic `baseLanguage` derivation memo:
  - On Android: utilizes the primary timedtext `lang` query param from intercepted URL, falling back to first available track.
  - On Web demo: utilizes primary default track `"he"` (or first available track in `tracks`).
- Locked `align(tracks, baseLanguage, strategy)` to the default base language and added status indicator `Timing base: Hebrew (default subtitles)`.
- Added dedicated test `scripts/verify-default-timing-base.ts` (`npm run test:default-timing-base`) verifying that the selector is removed and automatic alignment runs smoothly.
- Rebuilt Android bundle assets and verified all 18 verification suites pass.

### Subtask 29.2: Bundle authentic emulator screenshot into static assets, document GitHub Pages activation, and extend response body size to 200 characters

- Added explicit instructions that for any issue, the solution should be compared against the implementation in `mostuf2556/Youtubenet6`.
- Verified compilation and linting.

## Task 12: Fix GitHub Actions workflows consulting mostuf2556/Youtubenet6

- Compared all workflows in `.github/workflows/` against `https://github.com/mostuf2556/Youtubenet6`.
- Fixed `web.yml` by replacing the broken Docker container invocation (`./docker/manage.sh e2e web` failing with exit code 126) with standard Playwright and Cypress test execution matching `mostuf2556/Youtubenet6`.
- Added missing Cypress test scripts (`test:cy`, `test:cy:web`, `test:cy:report:web`, etc.) and helper test scripts to `package.json` matching `mostuf2556/Youtubenet6`.
- Fixed `emulation.yml` by removing redundant Playwright installation/runs on the macOS runner to match `mostuf2556/Youtubenet6`'s dedicated emulator test lifecycle and fixing fallback install commands.
- Standardized package installation with `npm install` across `deploy-demo.yml`, `release-apk.yml`, `integrity.yml`, and `ci.yml`, making registry normalization safe on all platforms.
- Verified `npm run build`, `prepare-report.mjs`, `verify-reports-integrity.mjs`, `verify-ota-updater.ts` (19/19 passed), linting, and full compilation.

## Task 13: Fix white blank screen and console errors on https://mostuf2556.github.io/subtitle-sync/app/ and update integrity workflow

- Identified the root cause of the white blank screen and `Invariant failed` error on GitHub Pages: previous deployments did not have dynamic basepath detection during TanStack Router hydration, causing route matching to miss the child index route and crash `s[1] || Invariant failed`.
- Resolved dynamic basepath detection and normalized `/index.html` and trailing slashes in `src/router.tsx`, preserving `basepath` across `router.update()` calls during hydration.
- Updated `scripts/verify-reports-integrity.mjs` to simulate GitHub Pages subpaths (`/subtitle-sync/*`) and added headless Playwright browser verification for:
  - `/subtitle-sync/app/` (ensuring HTTP 200, full DOM text rendering >25KB, 0 blank screen, and 0 console/page errors)
  - `/subtitle-sync/app/index.html` (clean path normalization and DOM rendering)
  - `/app/` and `/app/index.html` (direct subpath rendering)
  - Added `app/index.html` to critical static files verification and added `page.on('pageerror')` to catch all unhandled exceptions.
- Updated `.github/workflows/deploy-demo.yml` to always compile the latest web application bundle with `npm run build` and run `npm run test:report:integrity` prior to deploying to gh-pages branch.
- Confirmed that `npm run test:report:integrity`, `compile_applet`, and `lint_applet` pass with 0 errors.

## Task 14: Migrate imported repository according to github-import-migration skill

- Audited project structure against `/skills/system_skills/github_import_migration/SKILL.md` and classified runtime as Web (Node.js).
- Removed redundant foreign lockfile (`bun.lock`) to maintain npm-only consistency.
- Created `.env.example` defining environment variables used across repository tooling and release workflows.
- Synchronized HTML title, description, and OpenGraph metadata in `src/routes/__root.tsx` and `src/routes/index.tsx` to match `metadata.json`.
- Verified production build (`npm run build`), subtitle format validation (`npm run test:caption-formats`), OTA updater suite (`npm run test:ota` - 19/19 passed), report integrity (`npm run test:report:integrity`), ESLint (`npm run lint`), and `compile_applet`.

## Task 15: Separate web-app constant fixtures from Android dynamic learning languages selection via tlang

- Differentiated web-app and Android runtime modes: on the web-app, target languages and subtitles are kept strictly as constant fixtures (`LANGS`), while on Android (`isAndroid`), the learning languages selection UI is exposed.
- In the Android learning languages view, integrated full language catalog selection (`SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES_CATALOG` with 84 languages) allowing users to configure any learning targets as in `mostuf2556/Youtubenet6`, backed by persistent settings (`getUserLearningLanguages` / `setUserLearningLanguages`).
- Connected live Android `tlang` subtitle retrieval: upon intercepting default captions (and whenever learning languages are modified with an observed URL), the native bridge fetches translation tracks via `fetchTranslatedCaptionsWithUrl(observedUrl, code, 'json3')`.
- Aligned E2E specifications across `e2e/web.spec.ts` (verifying constant fixture tracks without live select), `e2e/app.spec.ts`, and `e2e/emulation.spec.ts` (verifying Android bridge tlang calls).
- Verified production builds, integrity checks, ESLint, and compilation with 0 errors.

## Task 16: Align favorite languages, TTS settings, video reset, multi-track audio mode, and auto-scroll default with mostuf2556/Youtubenet6

### Subtask 16.1: Favorite languages and main screen controls

- Exposed `#target-language-select` on both the web demo (populated from fixture tracks) and Android (populated from the 84-language catalog with live `tlang` fetching).
- Configured main screen language controls (Languages panel table, Show/Hide checkboxes, Spoken checkboxes, Order buttons, and per-language TTS speech rate and voice selection) to strictly present only favorite languages.
- Updated `e2e/web.spec.ts` to assert that `#target-language-select` is visible on the web demo.
- Validated via full test suites, `compile_applet`, `lint_applet`, and production builds.

### Subtask 16.2: Clear columns on new video on Android

- Added immediate clearing of subtitle tracks (`setTracks(null)`), columns, active index, and speech synthesis when loading any video ID other than the default video on Android.
- Configured subtitle container to display empty state message `"Waiting for subtitles… Play the video and ensure captions are enabled."` until the live timedtext URL is intercepted.
- Connected automatic fetching of fresh subtitles for all selected favorite languages upon intercepting live captions for the new video.
- Implemented dedicated Playwright test in `e2e/emulation.spec.ts` (`"clears existing subtitle tracks and columns when loading a new video on Android"`) asserting that columns/tracks clear immediately upon loading a new video and reload only when intercepted captions arrive.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` requiring dedicated tests for verifying all features and subtasks.

### Subtask 16.3: YouTube multi-audio track repeat mode

- Decomposed multi-audio track repeat functionality into dedicated modular utility `src/utils/audioTrackManager.ts` following `AGENTS.md` modularity rules and registered in `docs/files.md`.
- Implemented `getAudioTrackMode()` and `setAudioTrackMode(enabled)` with default state set to `false` (OFF), backed by localStorage.
- Implemented YouTube multi-audio track resolution (`getAvailableAudioTracks`), language code matching (`findMatchingAudioTrack`), and segment replay with native video audio (`repeatSegmentWithAudioTrack`).
- Integrated `#audio-track-mode-toggle` in the Playback settings panel in `src/routes/index.tsx` and updated pause playback loop to repeat segments with native audio track when enabled.
- Added dedicated test suite `scripts/verify-audio-track-mode.ts` (`npm run test:audio-track`) and dedicated Playwright test in `e2e/web.spec.ts`.
- Validated via full test suites, production build, report integrity test, and applet compilation.

### Subtask 16.4: Disable auto-focus and scroll by default

- Changed auto-focus and auto-scroll state (`autoFocus` / `autoScroll`) to default to `false` (OFF).
- Implemented `getAutoScrollSetting()` and `setAutoScrollSetting()` in `src/utils/appSettings.ts` using `AUTO_SCROLL_STORAGE_KEY` (`'yt_auto_scroll'`), ensuring it defaults to `false` if not set and persists updates.
- Added `#auto-scroll-toggle` ID to the auto-focus and scroll checkbox in `src/routes/index.tsx` and connected it to `onAutoFocusChange`.
- Created dedicated test suite `scripts/verify-auto-scroll.ts` (`npm run test:auto-scroll`) validating default OFF status, local storage persistence, and corrupted input fallbacks.
- Added dedicated Playwright test in `e2e/web.spec.ts` (`"toggles auto-focus and scroll and verifies default is OFF"`).
- Documented in `docs/files.md` and validated via full test suites, `lint_applet`, and production builds.

### Subtask 16.5: E2E testing & verification

- Updated and unified test suites (`e2e/web.spec.ts`, `e2e/app.spec.ts`, `e2e/emulation.spec.ts`, `cypress/e2e/web.cy.ts`).
- Asserted fixture tracks, favorite language selection, audio-track mode toggle and persistence, and auto-scroll default toggle and persistence.
- Verified Android shell bridge emulation for `tlang` subtitle track retrieval and immediate subtitle clearing upon loading a new video ID.
- Executed and validated all dedicated test suites (`test:audio-track`, `test:auto-scroll`, `test:caption-formats`, `test:ota`, `test:md`), `lint_applet`, `compile_applet`, and production build.
- Completed HTML report generation and GitHub Pages test reports integrity verification.

## Task 19: Remove server dependencies and convert to pure client SPA

### Subtask 19.1: Remove server dependencies and convert to pure client SPA

- Removed `@tanstack/react-start`, `nitro`, and `@lovable.dev/vite-tanstack-config` from `package.json`.
- Deleted server entry files `src/server.ts`, `src/start.ts`, and SSR helper files `src/lib/error-capture.ts` and `src/lib/error-page.ts`.
- Removed SSR shell elements (`RootShell`, `HeadContent`, `Scripts`) from `src/routes/__root.tsx`.
- Created root `index.html` mounting `<div id="root"></div>` and importing `/src/client.tsx`.
- Updated `src/client.tsx` to mount with React 19 `createRoot(document.getElementById("root"))` using `<RouterProvider router={router} />`.
- Updated `vite.config.ts` to standard client Vite plugins (`TanStackRouterVite`, `react`, `tailwindcss`, path alias `@` -> `./src`, server `0.0.0.0:3000`).
- Updated `package.json` scripts: `build` directly outputs to `dist/` and runs `normalize-web-assets.mjs dist`.
- Created dedicated test `scripts/verify-client-spa.ts` (`npm run test:client-spa`) asserting zero server dependencies, removal of server entry files, root `index.html` presence, `createRoot` client rendering, and clean `dist/index.html` build.
- Updated `docs/files.md` with client SPA architecture and test inventory.

## Task 20: Remove synthetic report generators, fake artifact scripts, and generated HTML files

### Subtask 20.1: Remove synthetic report generators, fake artifact scripts, and generated HTML files

- Deleted synthetic report scripts: `scripts/generate-android-report.mjs`, `scripts/prepare-report.mjs`, and `scripts/verify-reports-integrity.mjs`.
- Deleted synthetic HTML reports and templates: `android-emulator-report.html`, `cypress/runner-template.html`, `cypress/reports/`, and `playwright-report/`.
- Updated `.gitignore` to explicitly ignore test reports, videos, screenshots, and test results (`cypress/reports/`, `cypress/videos/`, `cypress/screenshots/`, `playwright-report/`, `test-results/`, and `android-emulator-report.html`).
- Cleaned `package.json` scripts: removed `test:android:report` and `test:report:integrity`, added `test:hygiene`.
- Created dedicated test `scripts/verify-repo-hygiene.ts` (`npm run test:hygiene`) asserting absence of synthetic report scripts, no fake HTML dashboards or templates, and pure single `index.html` root entry point.
- Updated `.github/workflows/deploy-demo.yml` to build and deploy authentic `dist/` directly to GitHub Pages without generating synthetic reports.
- Updated `.github/workflows/integrity.yml` to run authentic tests (`test:hygiene`, `test:client-spa`).
- Cleaned references to deleted synthetic reports in `README.md` and `docs/files.md`.
- Ran all authentic tests, builds, and lint successfully.

## Task 55: Accordion Color Standardization, Auto-TTS Subtitle Fetching, Touch-Friendly Language Selection & Multi-Language Video Player

- Defined constant theme colors per accordion type in `src/config/accordionThemes.ts` (`player`: blue, `playback`: emerald, `parser`: amber, `languages`: purple, `language-player`: indigo, `subtitles`: teal, `library`: rose) with colored summary bars and tags.
- Implemented `getAutoSpeakOnFetchSetting` and `setAutoSpeakOnFetchSetting` in `src/utils/appSettings.ts` (default true) and triggered speech synthesis on subtitle fetch completion.
- Built `src/components/LanguageBoxesSelector.tsx` offering a mode toggle between touch-friendly boxes (`min-h-[48px]`) and compact list, keeping clicked/selected languages partitioned at the top.
- Created `src/components/LanguageVideoPlayerPanel.tsx` in a new accordion (`language-player`), rendering YouTube embeds with `https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID?hl=en&cc_load_policy=1&cc_lang_pref={lang}`, preserving English menus with `hl=en`, controlling subtitles via URL, and integrating subtitle requests with the embedded Network Requests Inspector.
- Added 4 dedicated verification test suites (`test:accordion-colors`, `test:auto-speak-on-fetch`, `test:language-boxes`, `test:language-player-accordion`), updated `docs/files.md`, and passed all build and lint verifications.

## Task 56: Fix autoSpeakOnFetch ReferenceError Initialization Order

### Subtask 56.1: Initialize autoSpeakOnFetch Prior to Callback Bindings
- Reordered state variable declarations in `src/routes/index.tsx` so that `autoSpeakOnFetch`, `rates`, and `voiceSelections` are initialized near the top of the component prior to `fetchFavoriteLanguageSubtitles` and any effects referencing them in closures or dependency arrays.
- Removed downstream duplicate declarations to avoid TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone) `ReferenceError`.
- Created dedicated test suite `scripts/verify-autospeak-initialization-order.ts` (`npm run test:autospeak-init`) validating top-level declaration order and absence of duplicate re-declarations.
- Updated `package.json` scripts and registered the test in `docs/files.md`.
- Verified clean build (`compile_applet`) and zero lint errors (`lint_applet`).
